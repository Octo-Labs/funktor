  # MAX_JOB_DELAY_IN_SECONDS controls the maximum delay that will be put on a randomly generated job.

  # These values control how many random jobs will be generated per second. With extremely high values
  # the generator may become limited by how quickly it can push to SQS. If you need to test LOTS of
  # jobs you may want to set the tiemout to be longer and increase reservedConcurrency so that you
  # can have multiple random generators running at one time.

  # MAX_JOB_LENGTH_IN_SECONDS controls how long the slowest job will take to execute (by sleeping)
